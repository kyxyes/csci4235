====================
<p><b>About Project GOZoom</b></p>
<p>1, I design a button "on/off" for this extension, if you do not want to use. Just click the button and you do have to remove.</p>
<p>2, I design two buttons ,"zoomout" and "zoomin" , to change the size for preview window.</p>
<p>3, I design two models for my extension ,M1 is for whole and original mini preview of website and M2 is for redesign(including title ,pic and text). Just switch the button on popup and refresh to change the model.</p>
<p>4, hold  'alt ' for preview reading when mouse leave.</p>


=====================
<p><b>About Project GOTabs</b></p>
Number of windows open and tabs(in BadgeText) in each window including titles, url and selected tab(here I use red font). 
You can also click title in pupup and switch to different tab.
Because I think this will make this extension more meaningful. So I add 'id' in dictionary Tab of widget.idl.
